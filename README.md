## Bird Species Classification
Scientists have determined that a known species of bird should be divided into 3 distinct and separate species. These species are endemic to a particular region of the country and their populations must be tracked and estimated with as much precision as possible. As such, a non-profit conservation society has taken up the task. They need to be able to log which species they have encountered based on the characteristics that their field officers observe in the wild. 

Using certain genetic traits and location data, can you predict the species of bird that has been observed?

This is a beginner-level practice competition and your goal is to predict the bird species (A, B, or C) based on attributes or location.
